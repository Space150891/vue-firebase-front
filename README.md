### Description
```
When the focus disappears from the field, the user is added (if it was not there before),
and with the next changes, the fields in the database are updated. as soon as the first 
interaction with any field takes place, id user is saved in the store and with the 
following changes in the fields, the base of this user is updated.

The button resets the user's ID and makes the forms empty for the next new user
